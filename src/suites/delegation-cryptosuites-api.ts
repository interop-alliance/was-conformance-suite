/**
 * WAS conformance tests -- delegation-proof cryptosuites (OPTIONAL).
 *
 * A delegated capability's `proof` is a signature on the document, separate
 * from the capability invocation's HTTP signature. This suite asserts a server
 * accepts both cryptosuites in use, rather than the run silently tracking
 * whichever one it happens to send.
 *
 * The two are not on the same footing. The rest of this conformance suite signs
 * its delegations with `eddsa-jcs-2022`, which canonicalizes with JCS and so
 * costs no JSON-LD canonicalization; that is what current WAS clients emit, so
 * every delegated test in the required set already depends on a server
 * accepting it, and the test for it here is required too.
 *
 * `Ed25519Signature2020` is the older suite, and its tests are marked optional:
 * a server may reasonably have moved past it, and the spec's authorization
 * profile names no cryptosuite at all. Accepting it is still what keeps two
 * populations working -- clients that have not upgraded, and wallets that
 * recorded a grant before the switch and submit that stored capability back for
 * revocation under the suite it was signed with.
 *
 * The two are told apart by `proof.type` and `proof.cryptosuite`, with no
 * heuristic, so a server may accept both at once and the links of a single
 * chain may mix them. The mixed-chain test here runs the one direction any
 * client can produce unaided: an `Ed25519Signature2020` parent with an
 * `eddsa-jcs-2022` child. The reverse needs the old-suite client to be handed a
 * document loader serving the data-integrity context -- URDNA2015 expands the
 * parent embedded in `proof.capabilityChain` -- and it throws at signing time,
 * on the client, before any server sees the chain. That is a client-side
 * limitation rather than a server property, so it is out of scope here.
